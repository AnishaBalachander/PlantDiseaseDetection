# Plant Disease Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection System, a powerful tool designed to diagnose and monitor diseases affecting Potato, Tomato, and Bell Pepper leaves. Leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology implemented with TensorFlow, our system provides accurate and efficient image recognition for plant health assessment.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** Our system employs a robust CNN model, known for its superior image recognition capabilities, to accurately identify diseases in plant leaves.

- **Flask Web Application:** Seamlessly integrated into a Flask web application, our system allows users to perform real-time disease diagnosis by simply uploading a photo of the affected plant.

- **Webcam Integration:** To enhance usability, the system can leverage webcams for continuous and effortless monitoring of plant health.

## Results and Approach

The implementation of our CNN-based Plant Disease Detection System has yielded promising results, demonstrating commendable accuracy in pinpointing diseases affecting the specified crops. Beyond mere detection, our system stands out for its integration of actionable solutions, offering a comprehensive approach to plant health management.
